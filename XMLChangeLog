	* doc/.cvsignore Now all .info, .html, .ps and .dvi files are
	ignored (not only those generated from xmlgawk).

Sa Mar 12 21:38:02 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>
	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.in
	* With these files checked in, it is now possible to produce
        xmlgawk.ps and xmlgawk.html. The whole process is not quite
	clean yet. make html fails at first sight, but the file is
	created and usable. After a fresh cvs co of xmlgawk, the first
	make in the top directory will fail for some reason in the doc
	directory. Furthermore, gawk.texi has some problems. But all
	this sounds worse than it is because everything is produced
	correctly anyay.

Sat Mar 12 20:58:52 UTC 2005  Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>
	* doc/fdl.texi The file doc/fdl.texi is included by doc/xmlgawk.texi.
	* doc/awk_proc.eps doc/docbook_chapter.eps doc/rss_inq.eps
	doc/soap_error.eps doc/soap_reply.eps doc/soap_request.eps
	are new files used by doc/xmlgawk.texi.
	* doc/xmlgawk.texi The .eps files have been checked in under
	slightly different names.

	* xml_puller.c (XML_PullerNext): If read returns -1, we should set
	puller status to XML_STATUS_ERROR to indicate that there was an I/O
	error.

Sat Mar 12 20:23:26 UTC 2005  Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* awk.h: Declare XMLEVENT_node.
	* main.c: New global variable XMLEVENT_node.
	(varinit) Added entry for XMLEVENT.
	* io.c: Add static xml_event_* variables to cache XMLEVENT values.
	(resetXMLvars): Must reset new XMLEVENT variable.
	(iop_alloc): If opening an XML file, check whether xml_event_* variables
	have been initialized yet; if not, call xml_event_init.
	(xml_event_init): New function to initialize xml_event_* variables.
	(get_xml_record): For each kind of token returned by XML_PullerNext,
	set an appropriate value for XMLEVENT.

Sat Mar 12 18:37:14 UTC 2005  Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .cvsignore: Ignore changes in awkgram.c.
	* doc/.cvsignore: Ignore various files produced from the texinfo
	  source documentation.

          and Makefile changes will follow later.
