        Sync with savannah gawk cvsps 264.
        Update infrastructure; main goal is to keep libsigsegv from installing.
        Update to Autoconf 2.63, Automake 1.11, Libtool 2.2.6a.

        This patch seems out of sync (see libsigsegv/ChangeLog).
        Arnold or me, someone seems to have forgotten some patches.
        I hope this will be fixed later with cvsps 283.
        I will commit these sources because they can be built.
        This wil have to be fixed later; possibly by copying.
        Generated files are still under CVS control.
	cvsps 264 says:

	m4/libtool.m4:INITIAL->1.1 
	m4/ltoptions.m4:INITIAL->1.1 
	m4/ltsugar.m4:INITIAL->1.1 
	m4/ltversion.m4:INITIAL->1.1 
	m4/lt~obsolete.m4:INITIAL->1.1 

	This is nonsense and these file will stay unchanged.
	Only ChangeLog will be changed to keep it in sync.
