This is gawkextlib.  It contains several shared library extension packages
for gawk, as well as libgawkextlib containing some APIs that are useful
for extension packages.

Note: It should be possible to replace the use of legacy xgawk with gawk
version 4.1 or later in combination with gawkextlib except for one known
incompatibility: in gawk 4.1, the @include and @load directives require double
quotes around the filename.  With xgawk, there were no quotes.  Please let us
know if you find any other incompatibilities.

Each extension is now located in a separate subdirectory.
The "shared" subdirectory contains some files that are used by many extensions.
The individual extension can create a symbolic link into this directory
to avoid unnecessary duplication.

The gawkextlib library is in the lib subdirectory.  The libgawkextlib library
contains the strhash API used by pgsql and gd and haru, and the gawk_varinit
API to make it easy to initialize variables (used by XML and MPFR).  An
individual extension may choose to use this library, but that is optional.  At
the moment, all the extensions provided here are using gawkextlib.

To use these libraries, you must use a current version of gawk containing
shared extension library support.  Please use gawk 4.1.1 or later, or use this
recipe to build from the git sources:

   git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gawk.git
   cd gawk
   ./bootstrap.sh
   ./configure --prefix=/tmp/newgawk
   make && make check && make install

After you build and install that in /tmp/newgawk, you can then build
gawkextlib like so:

Using git:
   git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/gawkextlib/code gawkextlib
   cd gawkextlib

Then build the gawkextlib library:
   cd lib
   autoreconf -i && \
   	./configure --with-gawk=/tmp/newgawk --prefix=/tmp/gelib && \
   	make && make check && make install

You can build any given extension using a similar approach:
   cd <extension>
   autoreconf -i && \
	./configure --with-gawk=/tmp/newgawk --with-gawkextlib=/tmp/gelib \
   		--prefix=/tmp/gawk-<extension> && \
   	make && make check && make install

If you do not have current autotools installed, you can instead download
the tarballs for the gawkextlib library and any extensions that you
would like to install.

Either way, the steps to build are always the same:
   ./configure --with-gawk=/tmp/newgawk --with-gawkextlib=/tmp/gelib \
   	--prefix=/tmp/gawk-<extension> && \
   make && make check && make install

N.B. On an rpm-based system, if gawk 4.1.1 or later has been installed,
you can simply say:
   rpmbuild -tb gawkextlib-<version>.tar.gz
After installing the gawkextlib rpm, you can then build the individual
extension rpms like so:
   rpmbuild -tb gawk-<extension>.tar.gz

If you would like to add translations for an extension, please do something
like the following after running "make":
   cd <extension>/po
   msginit -l <locale>
   echo <locale> >> LINGUAS
   git add <locale>.po
Then edit the new <locale>.po file to add translations.  I have included a
fr.po translation as a placeholder, but there are currently no translations in
there.

Note to developers adding new extensions: please provide documentation for the
functions in your new extension library!  In the past, we have created texinfo
documentation, but it looks like the main gawk project is providing both
texinfo and man page documentation.  Please select at least one of these
approaches.

Also, it probably makes sense to use a single top-level ChangeLog for
each new extension.  The existing extensions have a separate ChangeLog
in each subdirectory, but that seems like a lot of maintenance overhead
for small projects like these.
