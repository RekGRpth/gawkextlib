This is gawkextlib.  It contains several shared library extension packages
for gawk, as well as libgawkextlib containing some APIs that are useful
for extension packages.

It should be possible to replace the use of legacy xgawk with gawk version 4.1
in combination with gawkextlib except for one known incompatibility: in gawk
4.1, the @include and @load directives require double quotes around the
filename.  With xgawk, there were no quotes.  Please let us know if you find
any other incompatibilities.

This package contains the following gawk shared libraries:
   xml
   pdf
   pgsql
   gd
   mpfr (but please compare to using gawk's new -M flag)

The libgawkextlib library contains the strhash API used by pgsql and gd,
and the gawk_varinit API to make it easy to initialize variables (used
by XML and MPFR).

To use this library, you must first build the new version of gawk
containing shared extension library support.  Please use gawk 4.1.1 or later,
or use this recipe to build from the git sources:

   git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gawk.git
   cd gawk
   ./bootstrap.sh
   ./configure --prefix=/tmp/newgawk
   make && make check && make install

After you build and install that in /tmp/newgawk, you can then build
gawkextlib like so:

Using git:
   git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/gawkextlib/code gawkextlib
   cd gawkextlib
   ./update-autotools

Or it may be easier from a tarball if you do not have current autotools
installed:
   tar xf gawkextlib-<version>.tar.gz
   cd gawkextlib-<version>

Either way, the steps to build are the same:
   ./configure --with-gawk=/tmp/newgawk --prefix=/tmp/newgawk
   make && make check && make install

N.B. On an rpm-based system, if gawk 4.1 or later has been installed,
you can simply say:
   rpmbuild -tb gawkextlib-<version>.tar.gz
