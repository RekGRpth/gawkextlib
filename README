This is gawkextlib.  It contains several shared library extension packages
for gawk, as well as libgawkextlib containing some APIs that are useful
for extension packages.  These extension libraries require the use
of gawk (GNU Awk) version 4.1.1 or later.

Please download gawkextlib plus one or more individual extensions.  You should
build and install gawkextlib first.  After you untar each package, please cd
into its directory and build as follows:

   ./configure && make && make check && make install && echo Success.

On an rpm-based system, such as Fedora, you can simply say:
   rpmbuild -tb gawkextlib-<version>.tar.gz
After installing the gawkextlib rpm, you can then build the individual
extension rpms like so:
   rpmbuild -tb gawk-<extension>.tar.gz

If you would like to build from git sources and have autotools installed,
the steps are very similar:

   git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/gawkextlib/code gawkextlib

Please build lib first, and then the extensions you want, like so:

   autoreconf -i && \
      ./configure && make && make check && make install && echo Success.

Please use the mailing lists to report bugs or contribute new code.
We welcome the contribution of new extensions.

Developers: please refer to the Development file.

Note: if you are using legacy xgawk, please upgrade to gawk version 4.1.1 or
later with these new packages.  There is only one known incompatibility between
xgawk and current gawk: in gawk 4.1 and later, the @include and @load
directives require double quotes around the filename.  With xgawk, there were
no quotes.  Please let us know if you find any other incompatibilities.
