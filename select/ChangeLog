2018-04-02         Manuel Collado       <m-collado@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/select.3am: Fix the title line of the manpage to mention gawk.

2018-02-28         Andrew J. Schorr     <ajschorr@fedoraproject.org>

	* packaging/gawk-select.spec.in: Add "BuildRequires: gcc"

2017-12-18         Andrew J. Schorr     <ajschorr@fedoraproject.org>

	* NEWS: Update for version 1.1.1.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Bump version to 1.1.1.
	* test/outputfd.awk: This test was failing on some extremely slow
	Fedora koji build virtual machines with a SIGPIPE, since we did not
	consume the second line of output. The simple fix is to read both
	lines before closing the pipe.
	* test/outputfd.ok: Update.

2017-12-17         Andrew J. Schorr     <ajschorr@fedoraproject.org>

	* packaging/gawk-select.spec.in: Add doc files test/nonblock.awk and
	test/signal.awk.

2017-12-17         Andrew J. Schorr     <ajschorr@fedoraproject.org>

2017-12-17         Andrew J. Schorr     <ajschorr@fedoraproject.org>

	* NEWS: Update for version 1.1.0.
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Bump version to 1.1.0.
	* README: Update information about compatible gawk versions.
	* doc/select.3am: Clarify that the 4th and 5th arguments to select 
	are optional.
	* packaging/gawk-select.spec.in: Upgrade to Fedora standards.
	* po/LINGUAS: Remove "fr", since we don't actually have a French
	translation.
	* po/fr.po: Delete file, since it contains nothing useful.
	* select.c: Upgrade to support gawk API version 2.  Extension
	functions take a 3rd argument in version 2, so use API_FINFO_ARG
	as a placeholder. Use #if tests to comment out lint checks that are
	redundant in version 2.
	(do_select): Fix minor bug whereby the signal array argument was
	ignored if more than 5 arguments were supplied.
	(func_table): Use new API_FUNC_MAXMIN and API_FUNC macros to declare
	function entries.
	* test/outputfd.awk: Remove calls to output_fd with one argument
	that now generate a fatal error in version 2 of the API where gawk
	ensures that the minimum number of required args are supplied.
	* test/outputfd.ok: Update to match changes in the test case.

	* select.c (signal2name): #include "name2signal.h" instead of
	"signal2name.h".

	to generate signal2name.h reliably, particularly on Cygwin where
	multiple platforms are supported by the same header file.

	* test/select.awk: No longer necessary to refer to PROCINFO, since the
	gawk bug has been fixed.
	* test/signal.{awk, ok}: Remove race condition that made this test
	unreliable.

2015-01-05         Andrew J. Schorr     <ajschorr@fedoraproject.org>

	* doc/select.3am: Document that set_non_blocking cannot instantiate
