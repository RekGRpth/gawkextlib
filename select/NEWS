Changes in 1.1.2
----------------
Fix a bug in parsing non-numeric timeout arguments. Due to a patch to
underlying gawk, this extension was parsing non-numeric timeout values
as a zero timeout, which led to undesirable polling behavior. This release
fixes the bug so that a timeout of "" or "fubar" now causes select to
block indefinitely. And a test case has been added to catch this problem.

Changes in 1.1.1
----------------
Fix a race condition in a test case.

Changes in 1.1.0
----------------
Upgraded to version 2 API in gawk 4.2.

Version 1.0.0
-------------
Migrated from the gawk select branch.
