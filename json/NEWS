- Stop importing JSON scalars that appear to be numeric as numbers and
  instead import the precise string (strnum) values so that gawk can see
  the exact string representation and do its own numeric conversions as
  appropriate.
- Enable mkbool test that requires the mkbool function added in
  gawk version 5.2.0.
