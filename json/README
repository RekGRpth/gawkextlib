============================
This is the json extension. It dumps a gawk multidimensional array
to a JSON object and reads a JSON object, recreating an equivalent
array.

You will need the gawkapi.h file from gawk 4.2.1 or later.

Note that this extension won't work with the gawkapi.h from 4.1.x;
that file uses at least one C++ keyword as a parameter name.

You will also need to have rapidJson installed where the compiler
can find it.

For documentation, see the man page.

For example usage, see test/json.awk.
