============================
This is the json extension. It dumps a gawk multidimensional array
to a JSON object and reads a JSON object, recreating an equivalent
array.

You will need the gawkapi.h file from gawk 4.2.1 or later. If that
has not yet been released, use the gawkapi.h file here.

Note that this extension won't work with the gawkapi.h from 4.1.x;
that file uses at least one C++ keyword as a parameter name.

You will also need to have rapidJson installed where the compiler
can find it.

For documentation, see the man page.

For example usage, see test/json.awk.
