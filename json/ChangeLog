	* NEWS: Update for version 1.0.2
	* configure.ac (AC_INIT): Bump version to 1.0.2.

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Remove gawkapi.h
	* README: Update comment regarding gawkapi.h, since gawk 4.2.1 has

2018-02-28         Andrew J. Schorr     <ajschorr@fedoraproject.org>

	* packaging/gawk-json.spec.in: Add "BuildRequires: gcc-c++"

2017-12-06         Andrew J. Schorr     <ajschorr@fedoraproject.org>

	* NEWS: Update for version 1.0.1.

	* packaging/gawk-json.spec.in: Improve comment, and stop attempting
	to install language translation files.

	translation. This file is now empty.
	* po/fr.po: Delete empty translation file.

2017-12-04         Andrew J. Schorr     <ajschorr@fedoraproject.org>

	Create a placeholder French message catalog so that the basic hooks
	are in place and the rpm will build properly.
	* po/LINGUAS: Create with contents "fr".
	* po/fr.po: Create a French message catalog.

2017-12-04         Andrew J. Schorr     <ajschorr@fedoraproject.org>

	* Makefile.am (json_la_SOURCES): Remove awkjsonhandler.h, since
	this is a header file, not a source file to be compiled.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Should contain awkjsonhandler.h and gawkapi.h.
	After gawk 4.2.1 is released, we should remove gawkapi.h.
	* packaging/gawk-json.spec.in: Specify that we build only against
	version 4.2.0 of gawk, since we should remove the private copy of
	gawkapi.h once 4.2.1 comes out.

2017-12-04         Andrew J. Schorr     <ajschorr@fedoraproject.org>

	* configure.ac: Replace AC_GAWK_EXTENSION with AC_PURE_GAWK_EXTENSION
	to eliminate the dependency on gawkextlib.

2017-12-04         Andrew J. Schorr     <ajschorr@fedoraproject.org>

	* json.cpp: Include <gawkapi.h> instead of "gawkextlib.h", since we
	are not actually using any gawkextlib facilities.
	* packaging/gawk-json.spec.in: Remove BuildRequires dependency
	on gawkextlib-devel, since this is a standalone extension.

2017-12-04         Andrew J. Schorr     <ajschorr@fedoraproject.org>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Remove, since we are not using common.h
	and unused.h.
	* common.h, unused.h: Remove symbolic links to shared header files,
	since this package does not use them.
	* packaging/gawk-json.spec.in: Upgrade to Fedora standards.

2017-11-24         Andrew J. Schorr     <ajschorr@fedoraproject.org>

	* json.c (func_table): Specify min_required_args to avoid compiler
	errors from older gcc versions.
