	* getXMLEVENT.awk (getXMLEVENT): Use local variable ex for
	looping instead of variable attr, which produced a name clash.

	* dtdgport.awk: Corrected a typo in a comment.

	* dtdgport.awk: New script intended to be portable.
	It implements the DTD generator, but it is based on the
	portable subset of XMLgawk.

	* getXMLEVENT.awk: Created new file. This script started as a
	copy of Jan Weber's getXML.awk. I changed and extended it so
	that it supports Style B of the XMLgawk API as close as possible.
	Most new features of the script are currently scarcely tested.

	* xmllib.awk: Manuel replaced the obsolete XMLVERSION and XMLENCODING
	with XMLATTR["VERSION"] and XMLATTR["ENCODING"]. He introduced
	XMLATTR["STANDALONE"] and replaced the obsolete XMLDOCTPUBID and
	XMLDOCTSYSID with XMLATTR["PUBLIC"] and XMLATTR["SYSTEM"].

	* xmlgawk.sh: New script to be installed in $(bindir).
