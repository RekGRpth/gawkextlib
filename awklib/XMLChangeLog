Sun Aug 12 14:59:01 UTC 2007 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	Sync with savannah gawk cvsps 135.

        * Makefile.am: Upgrade to GPL v3.

Sun Jun 17 12:27:50 UTC 2007 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	Sync with savannah gawk cvsps 122.

	* ChangeLog, Makefile.am: Add missing dependencies on stamp-eg.
	Ignoring patches for file Makefile.in

Sun Apr  1 12:24:33 CEST 2007 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* awklib/eg/lib, awklib/eg/prog:
	Remove last vestiges of arnold@gnu.org.
	Not a single character changed by this patch.
	Ignoring cvsps 74 (AWK scripts in awklib/eg/lib and
	awklib/eg/prog are not in our CVS source tree).

Sun Apr  1 09:45:29 UTC 2007 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Removed the double-declaration of AWKPROG
	that I accidentally introduced when merging cvsps 71.

Mon Mar 26 19:45:22 UTC 2007 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* ChangeLog, Makefile.am:
	Sync with savannah gawk cvsps 71.
	Make extract smarter about locales.
	Ignoring patches for file Makefile.in
	Ignoring newly inserted "rm -fr eg.old" in target clean-local.
	We have found a slightly different solution in April 2005 (see below).
	Ignoring changed "$(AWKPROG) -f extract.awk" in target stamp-eg.
	Unlike Arnold, we are addressing all files relative to $(srcdir).

Mon Jan 22 20:55:28 UTC 2007 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Use $^ instead of $< (should be more portable this way).

Sun Jan 21 14:55:16 UTC 2007 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Allow rebuilding from a VPATH build.

Fri Mar 17 20:05:04 UTC 2006 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Remove definitions of pkgdatadir and pkglibexecdir,
	and rely upon configure.ac to provide them.
	Remove "libexec_PROGRAMS = pwcat grcat" since we already have
	the correct line "pkglibexec_PROGRAMS = pwcat grcat".
	* xmlgawk.sh: Now execs "xgawk" instead of "gawk".

Thu Feb  9 17:40:43 UTC 2006 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am(xmlgawk): On AIX 5.2, the make tools seems to
	not know $< (perhaps only known in suffix rules).
	So I replaced $< with the first dependency.
	
Sat Apr  9 21:28:38 UTC 2005 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: When setting locale for AWKPROG, there is no need to
	check GAWKLOCALE: we must specify the C locale to make sure extract.awk
	works properly.  Also, remove obsolete comment.

Sat Apr  9 17:43:38 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Replaced AWK with AWKPROG again now that we
	found the reason for the problem in extract.awk. All the
	scripts in this Makefile are now executed in GAWK's default
	locale and *not* in the user's locale.

Fri Apr  8 20:44:16 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Replaced AWKPROG with AWK during extraction
	of awklib/eg/lib files.

Thu Apr  7 21:15:33 UTC 2005 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Use built binary AWKPROG to generate the eg directory
	tree.  Fix EXTRA_DIST to include XMLChangeLog and needed files
	in the xml subdirectory (and avoid including the CVS directory).
	Remove eg tree from the distribution.

Thu Apr  7 16:44:40 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: stamp-eg is not copied anymore into the distribution.

Tue Apr  5 16:16:16 UTC 2005 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Install xmlgawk only if BUILD_XML is true.

Tue Apr  5 16:07:59 UTC 2005 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Copy xmlgawk from xml/xmlgawk.sh, and install (and
	uninstall) it in $(bindir).  Install xml/*.awk in $(datadir).
	* .cvsignore: Ignore generated file xmlgawk.
