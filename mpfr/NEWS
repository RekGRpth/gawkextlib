Changes from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3
---------------------------
- Functions now check the argument type to decide whether to retrieve the
  value as a floating-point number or as a string. This should eliminate
  loss of precision due to CONVFMT conversion, but may result in lower
  precision when high-precision strnum values are retrieved in double 
  precision.
- Fix FSF address in a few places.
- Upgrade rpm spec file to Fedora standards.

Changes from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2
---------------------------
- Fix bug in configure script.

Changes from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1
---------------------------

- Should now find message catalogs when installation prefix is a non-standard location.

Version 1.0.0
-------------
Now structured as a separate package.
