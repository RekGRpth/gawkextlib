	* gawklib.spec.in: The gawk 4.1 Fedora packaging does not use a separate

	require /usr/include/gawkapi.h to be present.

	* gawkextlib.spec.in: Rename packages to use gawkextlib prefix
	instead of gawklib, and individual libraries will use a gawkext-
	prefix instead of gawk-.  Also add some more examples as doc files.

2012-07-21         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* gawklib.spec.in: Build 6 binary packages.  This has not been tested,
	so probably does not work yet.  It will be easier to test after
	new gawk and gawk-devel rpms have been built.
