	* gawkextlib.spec.in: Fix some rpmlint complaints.

2013-09-12         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* gawklib.spec.in: The gawk 4.1 Fedora packaging does not use a separate
	gawk-devel rpm, so instead of depending on gawk-devel, we instead
	require /usr/include/gawkapi.h to be present.

	* gawklib.spec.in: Replace xmlgawk with gawkextlib in a few more places.

2012-07-22         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* gawklib.spec.in: Rename to gawkextlib.spec.in.
	* gawkextlib.spec.in: Rename packages to use gawkextlib prefix
	instead of gawklib, and individual libraries will use a gawkext-
	prefix instead of gawk-.  Also add some more examples as doc files.
	* .gitignore: Replace gawklib.spec with gawkextlib.spec.

	* gawklib.spec.in: Fix %setup command, and gawklib-devel now requires
	gawk-devel.

2012-07-20         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* gawklib.spec.in: Build 6 binary packages.  This has not been tested,
	so probably does not work yet.  It will be easier to test after
	new gawk and gawk-devel rpms have been built.

2012-07-09         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* xgawk.spec.in: Rename to gawklib.spec.in.
	* .gitignore: Replace xgawk.spec with gawklib.spec.
