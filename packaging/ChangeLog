	* gawklib.spec.in: Fix %setup command, and gawklib-devel now requires
	gawk-devel.

	* gawklib.spec.in: Build 6 binary packages.  This has not been tested,
	so probably does not work yet.  It will be easier to test after
	new gawk and gawk-devel rpms have been built.

	* xgawk.spec.in: Rename to gawklib.spec.in.
	* .gitignore: Replace xgawk.spec with gawklib.spec.
