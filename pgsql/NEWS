Changes in 1.1.0
----------------
- Upgrade to support gawk 4.2 API version 2.
- When built against API version >= 2, text data retrieved from the database
  will be created as user input instead of strings. So if they appear to
  contain numeric values, they will have the strnum attribute and may be
  treated as numbers in comparisons. This applies to the values returned
  by pg_getvalue and pg_getcopydata, as well as the array values returned by
  pg_getrow and pg_getrowbyname. These changes could impact the behavior of
  your program, but should be more consistent with expected awk behavior.
