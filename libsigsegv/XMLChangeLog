        Sync with savannah gawk cvsps 264.
        Update infrastructure; main goal is to keep libsigsegv from installing.
        Update to Autoconf 2.63, Automake 1.11, Libtool 2.2.6a.

        This patch seems out of sync (see libsigsegv/ChangeLog).
        Arnold or me, someone seems to have forgotten some patches.
        I hope this will be fixed later with cvsps 283.
        I will commit these sources because they can be built.
        This wil have to be fixed later; possibly by copying.
	Generated files are still under CVS control.
