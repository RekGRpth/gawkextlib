Changes in 1.7.4
----------------
- Fix packaging to remove unnecessary dependency on gawkextlib.
- Update spec file to meet Fedora standards.

Changes from 1.6.0 to 1.7.0
----------------
- Upgrade to support gawk 4.2 API version 2.
- When built against API version >= 2, text data retrieved from the redis
  datastore will be created as user input instead of strings. So if they 
  appear to contain numeric values, they will have the strnum attribute and
  may be treated as numbers in comparisons. 
  These changes could impact the behavior of your program, but should be
  more consistent with expected awk behavior.
