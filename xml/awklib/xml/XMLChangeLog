	* xmltree.awk: Adapted to use the new xmlwrite.awk capabilities
	instead of writing to output by itself.

	* xmlwrite.awk: New library script provided by Manuel Collado.
	It is meant to help in the production of XML output.
	Manuel points out that some details of handling character encodings
	in the XML output cannot be done with a library script alone
	(because scripts dont have direct access to iconv).
	It has to be decided if any part should be moved into the
	XMLgawk extension.

	* xmlcopy.awk (STARTELEM): Remove extraneous 'split( $0, set, " " )'
	left over from previous version.

	* xmlcopy.awk: New library script provided by Manuel Collado.
	This is the initial version of Manuels xmlcopy script.
	This script should be used whenever you want XML data to be
	copied with slight modifications in character data or attributes.
	Unlike XSL, this script will still not allow you to move sub-trees
	from one place to another.

	This script has been recoded to be as efficient as possible,
	at the cost of severe restrictions:

	- Internal (XMCHARSET) and external (output) encodings must match
	- Unable to handle characters outside the given encoding
	- No indentation facilities
	- Only copy to stdout
	- Uses the same interface that input parsing: XMLEVENT, XMLNAME, ...
	- Making changes before copying requires changing these variables
	- etc.

	This library should be considered a temporary facility, that
	will eventually be replaced by built-in xmlwrite facilities in the future.

	* getXMLEVENT.awk (getXMLEVENT): Use local variable ex for
	looping instead of variable attr, which produced a name clash.

	* dtdgport.awk: Corrected a typo in a comment.

	* dtdgport.awk: New script intended to be portable.
	It implements the DTD generator, but it is based on the
	portable subset of XMLgawk.

	* getXMLEVENT.awk: Created new file. This script started as a
	copy of Jan Weber's getXML.awk. I changed and extended it so
	that it supports Style B of the XMLgawk API as close as possible.
	Most new features of the script are currently scarcely tested.

Fri Mar 24 17:49:07 UTC 2006 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* xmllib.awk: Manuel replaced the obsolete XMLVERSION and XMLENCODING
	with XMLATTR["VERSION"] and XMLATTR["ENCODING"]. He introduced
	XMLATTR["STANDALONE"] and replaced the obsolete XMLDOCTPUBID and
	XMLDOCTSYSID with XMLATTR["PUBLIC"] and XMLATTR["SYSTEM"].

Tue Apr  5 16:07:59 UTC 2005 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* xmlgawk.sh: New script to be installed in $(bindir).
