In 2005, JÃ¼rgen Kahrs wrote the original XMLgawk implementation by patching
gawk.  Andrew Schorr restructured this as a gawk shared library extension.
They jointly created the xgawk project as a more extensible fork of gawk that
provided a platform for implementing various gawk shared library extensions.
The xgawk shared library enhancements were largely merged into gawk
version 4.1, so there was no longer a need for xgawk.  This XML extension
is now a standard gawk shared library extension.

Stefan Tramm and Manuel Collado help with constructive criticism on conceptual
matters and user aspects.  Hirofumi Saito and Peter V. Saveliev do
multi-platform tests.
