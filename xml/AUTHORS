In 2005, the XMLgawk project at SourceForge adopted the source code
of GNU Awk 3.1.4 and created their own branch as a CVS repository.
The project aims at creating and supporting functional extensions.
All source code from Arnold Robbins' main source tree will be merged.
Source code of the XMLgawk project started with Juergen Kahrs' XML patch.
This patch was turned into an extension by Andrew Schorr.
Stefan Tramm and Manuel Collado help with constructive criticism on
conceptual matters and user aspects.
Hirofumi Saito and Peter V. Saveliev do multi-platform tests.
