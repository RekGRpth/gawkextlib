============================

The `posix' test will fail because of output format differences but this
is apparently otherwise benign.

Gawk uses the system's mktime(3) routine, even though Autoconf thinks
it's broken, so Caveat Emptor.

If you ask me about either of these I will fuss at you for not having
done your homework.
