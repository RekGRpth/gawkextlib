	* ChangeLog: Purge entries carried over from gawk.
	* Makefile.am: Fix libtool stuff to work properly as in the core
	gawk extensions Makefile.am.
	* common.h: New shared header file for these extensions.
	* gd.c, pgsql.c: Convert to new API.  Too many changes to document.
	The API is still evolving, so further changes will be required.
	Argument handling is much stricter now.
	Note: these changes have not been well tested.  There are most likely
	some conversion bugs lurking.
