2012-07-29         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* xml_interface.c (xml_get_record): No need to test for NULL errcode
	pointer.  Add new rt_start and rt_len arguments, and set *rt_len to
	0 to set RT to "".

2012-07-26         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* common.h (set_ERRNO): Redefine since update_ERRNO_string no longer
	takes a 2nd argument.
	* xml_interface.c (xml_parser): Add declaration for new
	register_input_parser API that replaces register_open_hook.
	(can_take_file): New boolean function indicating whether we want
	to parse the file.
	(take_control_of): New name for xml_iop_open.  Remove check for
	do_traditional flag, since we would never get here if operating
	in traditional mode.  Must now set opaque value ourselves, and return 1
	to indicate success.

2012-07-24         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* Makefile.am: Need to link with $(LIBINTL).
	* gd.c, mpfr.c, pgsql.c: Convert lintwarn messages to use gettext.
	* xml_interface.c (SET_ARRAY_ELEMENT): Use gettext in fatal message.

2012-07-22         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* common.h (set_ERRNO_no_gettext): Remove macro.
	(set_ERRNO): Never request translation by gawk, since we must translate
	using our own message catalogs.
	* gd.c, pgsql.c: Use set_ERRNO with _() macro so gettext will work.
	* xml_interface.c (xml_get_record): Use set_ERRNO instead of
	update_ERRNO_string to be consistent.

2012-07-22         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* Makefile.am: Rename from gawklib to gawkextlib.
	* common.h: Include gawkextlib.h instead of gawklib.h.
	* testpgsql.awk: Turn off execute bit.

2012-07-20         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* xml_interface.c: Make XMLEVENT and XMLNAME read-write so that
	the xmlcopy.awk and xmlwrite.awk libraries may work properly.
	The RESET_ARRAY code now works, but it is still slower, so not used.

2012-07-19         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* pgsql.c (do_pg_serverversion): New function to return server version.
	(func_table): Add pg_serverversion.

2012-07-17         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* xml_interface.c: Remove #ifdef USE_VALUE_COOKIE, since gawk now
	supports this feature.

2012-07-17         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* mpfr.c (load_vars): Create MPFR_EXACT as a constant; the other
	3 MPFR* variables may be changed by the user.
	* xml_interface.c (NUM_RESET): Do not define unless RESET_ARRAY is
	defined.
	(varinit): Remove XMLCHARSET from the array, since it is special.
	(xml_load_vars): Create most XML* scalars as read-only constants that 
	may not be changed by user code.  The only exceptions are XMLCHARSET,
	XMLMODE, and the XMLATTR array.
	(resetXMLvars_before): Remove invalid optimization -- clear_array
	is very efficient for empty arrays, so there is no need to check
	for a non-empty array before calling it.

2012-07-16         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* xml_interface.c: Optimize performance.  Under the new API, it
	is expensive to lookup or set a variable.  Previously, xml_get_record
	started by resetting all variables to "" and clearing the XMLATTR
	array.  Instead, we process the record and update each affected
	variable.  Afterwards, we reset to "" all variables whose generation
	counters do not match the current generation counter and are not
	already set to zero (indicating "").  For XMLATTR, we check the
	array length before clearing it.  This is much faster than calling
	array_clear without checking.  And XMLPATH is special because we
	do not want to reset it to "": it should always have the appropriate
	value for the current event.  So we track the XMLPATH version on
	a per-file basis and reset it as needed.  There is also commented-out
	code to use an experimental VALUE_COOKIE feature to which Arnold
	has not yet agreed.  This would improve performance if added to the API.
	We also use a new API feature to update XMLNAME using a scalar_cookie
	value of another variable.

2012-07-13         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* Makefile.am: Apply JÃ¼rgen Kahrs to fix locale problems encoding files.
	* xml_interface.c (SYM_UPDATE): Remove unused macro.

2012-07-12         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* mpfr.c (do_mpfr_abs): Use mpfr_abs instead of mpfr_set4.

2012-07-12         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* xml_interface.c (resetXMLvars): Upgraded code to test XMLPATH
	before updating it, but my benchmarks found no performance difference,
	so it is still commented out.

2012-07-12         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* common.h: No need to include gawkapi.h, since now included by
	gawklib.h.
	* xml_interface.c, mpfr.c: Use new API scalar_cookie feature to
	improve performance and simplify the code.

2012-07-11         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* testgd.awk, testpgsql.awk, testxml2pgsql.awk: In new gawk,
	@load requires quotes.
	* common.h: Include <unistd.h> before gawklib.h.
	(make_null_string): Rename to make_nul_string, since gawkapi.h now
	defines make_null_string, but that version uses memset to slow things
	down.  Define make_null_string to use make_nul_string implementation.
	(erealloc): Remove definition, since now in gawkapi.h.
	* gd.c, mpfr.c: Use gawkapi.h dl_load_func with new init_func.
	* pgsql.c: Use gawkapi.h dl_load_func with new init_func.
	(get_params): Fix argument number bug.
	(do_pg_fields, do_pg_fieldsbyname, do_pg_getrow, do_pg_getrowbyname):
	Use make_string_malloc instead of make_string_no_malloc, since
	set_array_element no longer does the malloc for us.
	(do_pg_getvalue): Replace dup_string with make_string_malloc.
	* xml_interface.c: Use gawkapi.h dl_load_func with new init_func.
	(RESET_XMLPATH): Must now use make_string_malloc.
	(update_xmlattr, set_xml_attr): Remove calls to free, since gawk now
	takes our memory.
	(COPY_STRING): Must now use make_string_malloc.
	(xml_get_record): Need to use make_string_malloc on a const string.

2012-07-11         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* common.h: Add gettext support.
	* mpfr.c, xml_interface.c: Remove _ macro definition, since gettext
	is now supported properly in common.h.

2012-07-10         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* mpfr.c: Port to new API.

2012-07-10         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* common.h (make_string_malloc, make_string_no_malloc, erealloc):
	New macros.
	* gd.c: Use make_string_malloc and make_string_no_malloc for
	greater clarity.
	* pgsql.c: Ditto.
	(do_pg_putcopyend): Tighten code.
	* xml_interface.c: Port to new API.

2012-07-09         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add common.h.

2012-07-09         Andrew J. Schorr     <aschorr@telemetry-investments.com>

	* ChangeLog: Purge entries carried over from gawk.
	* Makefile.am: Fix libtool stuff to work properly as in the core
	gawk extensions Makefile.am.
	* common.h: New shared header file for these extensions.
	* gd.c, pgsql.c: Convert to new API.  Too many changes to document.
	The API is still evolving, so further changes will be required.
	Argument handling is much stricter now.
	Note: these changes have not been well tested.  There are most likely
	some conversion bugs lurking.
