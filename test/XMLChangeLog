	I replaced the (first and only) XML data file with a different one.
	The previous file was well-formed but not valid (entitiy was used
	but not declared). We used two tools for testing this:
	xmllint (based on libxml2) complained about undefined entity 'hellip'
	xmlwf   (based on Expat)   did not complain because the file was w-f
	The file also had no XML header, so it was not possible to convert
	the contents properly into character encoding EUC-JP.

	* test/xdocbook.in:  New trivial XML file in UTF-8 which has XML header.
	* test/xdocbook.awk: Test script for testing some basic XML features.
	* test/xdocbook.out: Expected output of test script.

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in, Maketests: Inserted a section for testing XML.
	* xdocbook.awk: new file with first XML test case.
