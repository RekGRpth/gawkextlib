	XML tests will only be done when --enable-xml was configured.

	* test/Makefile.am: Inserted an "if BUILD_XMLGAWK" for xml tests.
	* test/Makefile.in: Generated from test/Makefile.am.

	Added test case xattr which tests if an XML tag with 10000
	attributes can be parsed.

	* test/xattr.awk: This script produces an XML document with 10000 attributes.
	* test/xdeep.ok:  This file contains the number of attributes (10000).

	* test/Makefile.am (xdeep2.awk): A new test case for deeply nested tags.
	Implemented non-recursively by Stefan so that platform with
	limited stack-size have a chance to show that they can parse
	deeply nested XML tags properly.
	* test/badargs.ok: Option -e was changed to -l.

Thu Mar 24 14:06:38 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	Added test case xdeep which tests if XML tags with a nesting depth
	of 10000 can be parsed. This question is not as trivial as it may
	sound.

	* test/xdeep.awk: This script produces a deeply nested XML document.
	* test/xdeep.ok:  This file contains the depth (10000).

	* test/badargs.ok: Andrew has added two new command line options.
        -e library              --extension=library
        -i includefile          --include=includefile

	I replaced the (first and only) XML data file with a different one.
	The previous file was well-formed but not valid (entitiy was used
	but not declared). We used two tools for testing this:
	xmllint (based on libxml2) complained about undefined entity 'hellip'
	xmlwf   (based on Expat)   did not complain because the file was w-f
	The file also had no XML header, so it was not possible to convert
	the contents properly into character encoding EUC-JP.

	* test/xdocbook.in:  New trivial XML file in UTF-8 which has XML header.
	* test/xdocbook.awk: Test script for testing some basic XML features.
	* test/xdocbook.out: Expected output of test script.

Fri Mar 18 22:42:53 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in, Maketests: Inserted a section for testing XML.
	* xdocbook.awk: new file with first XML test case.

        * ChangeLog created.
