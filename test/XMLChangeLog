Sun Mar 25 17:32:49 UTC 2007 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* double1.ok, double2.ok, ovrflow1.ok:
	Sync with savannah gawk cvsps 63.
	Further straighten out formatting of numbers.
	Rework some test cases for above.
	After this patchset, all test cases succeed again.
	The "special warning tests" still report bad news.

Thu Mar 22 20:16:28 UTC 2007 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

        * ChangeLog, Makefile.am: new test cases double1, double2 and zero2.
	* double1.awk, double1.ok, double2.awk, double2.ok, zero2.awk, zero2.ok:
	New files for new test cases.

        Sync with savannah gawk cvsps 56.
	After this patchset, the double2 test case fails.

Mon Mar 19 19:31:25 UTC 2007 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	Sync with savannah gawk cvsps 54.
	* ChangeLog: Accept new comments.
	* Makefile.am: Added new test parse1.
	  Unlike gawk-stable on Savannah, we dont have Makefile.in and Maketests.
	* parse1.awk, parse1.in, parse1.ok: New files.

Thu Feb  1 14:43:10 UTC 2007 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	Sync with savannah gawk cvsps 50.
	* ChangeLog: Accept new comments.
	* Makefile.am: Added new test reint2.  We already had intformat.
	Minor changes to diffout (white space) and valgrind-scan (semicolons)
	to match Savannah version.
	* reint2.awk, reint2.in, reint2.ok: New files.

Sun Jan 28 22:40:53 UTC 2007 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: (valgrind-scan) Scan all files matching log.* to be
	compatible with older versions of valgrind.
	(fmtspcl.ok) Always need srcdir for fmtspcl.awk.

Sun Jan 28 16:04:43 UTC 2007 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Fix to work when building in a different directory.

Sun Jan 28 13:52:03 UTC 2007 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* xmpfrmat.awk: Removed the "shebang" (#!) and corrected a typo.

Sat Jan 27 18:03:50 UTC 2007 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: (diffout) Fix bug in case there are no _* error files.
	(valgrind-scan) New target to scan valgrind log files for problems.

Fri Jan 26 21:58:10 UTC 2007 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .cvsignore: Ignore valgrind output log files.

Fri Jan 26 21:40:22 UTC 2007 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Eliminate some duplicate tests from the savannah
	patch merge: devfd, wideidx, widesub, widesub2, and widesub3.

Tue Nov 21 14:52:06 UTC 2006 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* xincl.ok: Now that awkgram.y has been patched to report the
	correct error locations, we need to fix xincl.ok to be consistent
	(previous incorrect error location was line 22 of assert.awk, which
	does not even exist).

Wed Jul 12 21:05:44 UTC 2006 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Add explicit rules for wideidx, widesub, widesub2, and
	widesub3.  These rules will use a default locale of en_US.UTF-8
	unless the user overrides it by setting the GAWKLOCALE environment
	variable.  This way, the bugs in gawk 3.1.5 are exposed by default
	when the user runs "make check" without setting GAWKLOCALE.

Wed Jul 12 17:20:43 UTC 2006 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* devfd.{in4,in5,ok},wideidx.{in,awk,ok},widesub.{awk,ok},
	widesub2.{awk,ok},widesub3.{in,awk,ok}: New test cases.
	* Makefile.am: (EXTRA_DIST) Add new files for devfd, wideidx,
	widesub, widesub2, and widesub3 tests.
	(BASIC_TESTS) Add wideidx widesub widesub2 widesub3.
	(UNIX_TESTS) Add devfd.
	(devfd) Custom rule for devfd test.

Wed Jul  5 02:33:02 UTC 2006 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: In pid test, no further need to remove _pid.in,
	since the test no longer creates that file.
	* pid.awk: Do not read correct values from stdin (they are now passed
	as command-line variables with -v).  Make sure to produce output
	if the comparisons are successful.
	* pid.ok: No longer empty, should contain 3 lines if all goes well.
	* pid.sh: Do not create _pid.in; instead, pass values in with -v.

Wed Mar 22 21:10:12 UTC 2006 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Must add convspcl.awk to EXTRA_DIST.

Wed Mar 22 20:36:24 UTC 2006 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* convspcl.awk: Check how IEEE special values (NaN & Inf) are handled.
	* Makefile.am: Run convspcl.awk as a special warning.

Wed Mar 22 17:59:34 UTC 2006 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* fmtspcl.{awk,tok}: New test case to confirm that NaN and Inf are
	being displayed properly be various printf formats.
	* .cvsignore: Ignore fmtspcl.ok (derived from fmtspcl.tok).
	* Makefile.am: Add the fmtspcl test case.

Fri Mar 17 20:05:04 UTC 2006 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Cosmetic change -- xml-msg-start and xml-msg-end
	now say "XML extension tests" instead of "xmlgawk extension tests".

Fri Feb 10 21:09:40 UTC 2006 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* test/Makefile.am: New test case xmpfrall for testing all of
	MPFR's functions.

Fri Feb 10 15:27:41 UTC 2006 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* xtime.{awk,ok}: When comparing elapsed time to requested sleep time,
	be more lenient to avoid false errors on busy machines.

Mon Feb  6 22:34:14 UTC 2006 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* test/Makefile.am: Test cases for MPFR are now done only
	when the MPFR extension has been built.

Sun Feb  5 14:27:09 UTC 2006 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* test/Makefile.am, test/xmpfrmat.awk test/xmpfrmat.ok:
	Introduced new regression test case for MPFR extension.
	This test case does the prime factorization of the third Fermat number.

Fri Jan 13 15:03:21 UTC 2006 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* intformat.awk: Stylistic improvement, but no real changes.

Fri Jan 13 14:08:52 UTC 2006 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* intformat.awk: Fix logic so it no longer complains about rounding
	errors on solaris/sparc (but still catches the big problems).

Fri Jan 13 00:16:20 UTC 2006 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* intformat.awk: Add tests for "%x" and "%o" formatting, and some
	more "%d" tests.

Thu Jan 12 22:47:51 UTC 2006 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* intformat.awk, intformat.ok: Add basic "%d" and "x" test.

Thu Jan 12 22:24:38 UTC 2006 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* intformat.awk: Simplify logic a bit (more for loop inside the check
	function).  And check printing of "0".

Thu Jan 12 21:21:29 UTC 2006 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Add new test intformat.
	* intformat.awk, intformat.ok: Check for some integer formatting
	problems.

Wed Jan 11 18:31:55 UTC 2006 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* xtime.awk, xtime.ok: Both files are needed in the distribution
	for regression test case xtime.

Tue Jan 10 20:35:54 UTC 2006 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Set XMLCHARSET=UTF-8 for all XML tests to avoid problems
	with iconv_open failing.

Mon Jan  9 16:01:58 UTC 2006 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Prevent automake from processing the 'include Maketests'
	directive by prepending a "-" character.

Fri Jan  6 18:59:16 UTC 2006 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* .cvsignore: Add Maketests.

Fri Jan  6 18:51:25 UTC 2006 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Maketests: Remove file that is built automatically by the Gentests
	awk script.

Tue Jan  3 21:32:11 UTC 2006 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Add test case for -ltime shared library.  And set up
	general framework for testing shared library functionality.
	* xtime.awk, xtime.ok: Test new -ltime library gettimeofday and
	sleep functions.

Thu Dec 22 00:44:10 UTC 2005 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: In xdocbook test, set environment variable WHINY_USERS.
	* xdocbook.ok: Change results to reflect WHINY_USERS setting.

Wed Apr 20 18:31:43 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Inserted some comments for the test cases which
	were written for the xgawk extensions. Inserted test case xuintmax.

Thu Apr  7 21:15:33 UTC 2005 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Clean up EXTRA_DIST: include *ChangeLog and specific
	files in reg and lib (to avoid getting CVS subdirs).

Thu Apr  7 15:01:36 UTC 2005 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Use CLEANFILES instead of supplying our own clean rule.

Mi Apr  6 17:07:39 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Removed non-existant files xload.awk xincl.awk
	from list of files. Appended xotlsjis.ok, xload.ok and xincl.ok
	to list of files.
 
Tue Apr  5 19:30:47 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am, xload.ok: The warning messages in test case
	xload are different, depending on the kind of linking and
	also depending on the platform. I did my best to remove any
	reference to linking and platform in test case xload.

Tue Apr  5 14:32:15 UTC 2005 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Fix bug introduced in last change.

Mon Apr  4 21:00:38 UTC 2005 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>
	
	* Makefile.am: Check BUILD_XML to decide whether to run the XML tests,
	and check BUILD_STATIC_EXTENSIONS to figure out how to load the XML
	extension library.

Mon Apr  4 17:20:01 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am (xload), xload.ok: This test case is insufficient.
	It must be re-written when all the details about linking the
	XML extension have settled.
	For the moment, I have modified it so that platform dependent
	messages will not disturb the testing.

Sat Apr  2 19:00:48 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am, xotlsjis.in, xotlsjis.ok: Added new test case
	for testing the Japanese character encoding x-sjis-cp932.
	Thanks to Hirofumi Saito for supplying this file.
	This encoding seems to be a bit unusual. Neither xmlwf nor
	xmllint recognize the encoding.

Fri Apr  1 20:24:02 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Test case xload's behavior depends on how
	xml.so is linked (statically or dynamically).

Fri Apr  1 19:59:19 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am, xload, xincl: Added two new test cases
	for testing the -i and -o command line options.

Thu Mar 31 19:21:25 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am: Changed the XML test cases so that failure does not
	cause termination of the Makefile. Andrew provided the scheme.

Thu Mar 31 17:19:03 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* xfujeucj.in, xfujutf8.in, xfujutf8.ok: Hirofumi says it is
	better to use these files for testing Japanese character encodings.

Thu Mar 31 15:50:36 UTC 2005 Andrew J. Schorr <ajschorr@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Maketests: Regenerate using Gentests; for some reason, the previous
	version has rules for xdocbook and xfujutf8.  They have been removed.

Tue Mar 29 19:03:01 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am (xdeep): Removed the test case from the list of
	test cases to run because it fails on so many systems for unrelated
	reasons (stack size limit).

Tue Mar 29 17:54:10 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	I've found the SHLIBEXT bug myself. I just defined it incorrectly.

	* Makefile.am (SHLIBEXT): Now set correctly.
	The same applies for files Makefile.in and Maketests.

Tue Mar 29 17:41:31 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	Up to now, XML tests were only done with statically linked XML.
	Now it should be possible to test XML with dynamical libs too.
	This currently works only with platform which have .so as SHLIBEXT.

	* Makefile.am (XMLLIB): Now XMLLIB contains the command line part
	for loading the XML shared lib. Notice that XMLLIB should not be
	used with other (non-XML) tests because tons of them will fail.
	Introduced SHLIBEXT, although it does not work correctly.
	Changed all XML test cases so that they use XMLLIB.
	The same applies for files Makefile.in and Maketests.
	* xfujutf8.awk (ERRNO): Andrew was right. It is useful to have
	an error handler, even in test scripts.
	
Mon Mar 28 15:33:30 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	Added new test case xfujeucj which reads a Japanese texts and
	produces an outline of the text. This test case uses the document
	from Apache
	  http://cvs.apache.org/~edwingo/jaxp-ri-1.2.0-fcs/samples/data/weekly-euc-jp.xml
	  http://cvs.apache.org/~edwingo/jaxp-ri-1.2.0-fcs/docs/samples.html
	as input. This document is encoded in EUC-JP. The new test case reads
	the document, produces an outline like the one in test case xfujutf8
	and compares the result with the result in test case xfujutf8.

Sat Mar 26 13:22:23 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>
	Added new test case xfujutf8 which reads a Japanese texts and
	produces an outline of the text. This test case was inspired
	by the Apache document
	  http://cvs.apache.org/~edwingo/jaxp-ri-1.2.0-fcs/samples/data/weekly-euc-jp.xml
	  http://cvs.apache.org/~edwingo/jaxp-ri-1.2.0-fcs/docs/samples.html
	The original document was encoded in EUC-JP, which is a very
	common encoding in Japan, but (as I understand it) has no proper
	place in the world of Unicode. Therefore, I converted the original
	document to UTF-8 (using iconv) and validated the resulting
	document with xmllint and xmlwf. This is how xfujutf8.in was made.
	Then I took the program outline (that comes with Expat) and sent
	xfujutf8.in through it to produce xfujutf8.ok. The actual test
	case xfujutf8 consists of letting xfujutf8.awk produce exactly
	the same result as Expat's outline program did.

Sat Mar 26 10:35:58 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>
	XML tests will only be done when --enable-xml was configured.

	* test/Makefile.am: Inserted an "if BUILD_XMLGAWK" for xml tests.
	* test/Makefile.in: Generated from test/Makefile.am.

Fri Mar 25 21:50:45 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	Added test case xattr which tests if an XML tag with 10000
	attributes can be parsed.

	* test/xattr.awk: This script produces an XML document with 10000 attributes.
	* test/xdeep.ok:  This file contains the number of attributes (10000).

Fri Mar 25 20:09:47 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* test/Makefile.am (xdeep2.awk): A new test case for deeply nested tags.
	Implemented non-recursively by Stefan so that platform with
	limited stack-size have a chance to show that they can parse
	deeply nested XML tags properly.
	* test/badargs.ok: Option -e was changed to -l.

Thu Mar 24 14:06:38 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	Added test case xdeep which tests if XML tags with a nesting depth
	of 10000 can be parsed. This question is not as trivial as it may
	sound.

	* test/xdeep.awk: This script produces a deeply nested XML document.
	* test/xdeep.ok:  This file contains the depth (10000).

Wed Mar 23 22:22:10 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* test/badargs.ok: Andrew has added two new command line options.
        -e library              --extension=library
        -i includefile          --include=includefile

Wed Mar 23 14:49:14 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	I replaced the (first and only) XML data file with a different one.
	The previous file was well-formed but not valid (entitiy was used
	but not declared). We used two tools for testing this:
	xmllint (based on libxml2) complained about undefined entity 'hellip'
	xmlwf   (based on Expat)   did not complain because the file was w-f
	The file also had no XML header, so it was not possible to convert
	the contents properly into character encoding EUC-JP.

	* test/xdocbook.in:  New trivial XML file in UTF-8 which has XML header.
	* test/xdocbook.awk: Test script for testing some basic XML features.
	* test/xdocbook.out: Expected output of test script.

Fri Mar 18 22:42:53 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in, Maketests: Inserted a section for testing XML.
	* xdocbook.awk: new file with first XML test case.

Mon Mar 14 22:04:27 UTC 2005 Juergen Kahrs <jkahrs@users.sourceforge.net>

        * ChangeLog created.
