Changes in 1.1.0
----------------
- Upgrade to support both the legacy API version 1 and the new version 2 API
  introduced in gawk 4.2.
- When built against API version >= 2, text data retrieved from the database
  using mdb_get or mdb_cursor_get will be created as user input instead of
  strings. So if they appear to contain numeric values, they will have the
  strnum attribute and may be treated as numbers in comparisons. These changes
  could impact the behavior of your program, but should be more consistent
  with expected awk behavior.

Changes from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1
---------------------------
Fix test case to avoid breaking with newer versions of gawk.

Version 1.0.0
-------------
First version.
